# Talent Swap

A platform to swap and learn new skills, all for the price of **nothing**!
You can create an account, search for requests, post your own and interact with other people.

## Running locally
Use any static web server from the project root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open <http://localhost:4173/Pages/index.html> on your browser

## Deployed model
Visit the deployed [website](https://talent-swap.vercel.app/) instead of running the project locally.
